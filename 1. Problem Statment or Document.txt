================== Problem Statement===========================

As a stakeholder and owner of a Bike Company, a potential data analytics problem statement could be:

"How can we optimize our product offerings and pricing strategies to maximize profit based on customer demographics and purchase behavior?"

To address this problem, the following data analytics questions could be explored:

Which age groups and genders are our most frequent customers, and what are their purchasing patterns?

Which product categories and sub-categories generate the most revenue and profit for the company?

Are there any geographic trends or patterns in customer behavior, such as certain states or countries having a higher demand for certain products?

How does the unit cost of a product affect its profitability, and is there an optimal pricing strategy that maximizes revenue while minimizing costs?

By analyzing and understanding customer demographics and purchasing behavior, the Bike Company can make data-driven decisions to optimize their product offerings and pricing strategies to maximize profits.
