End To End Data Analytics Project:

Hello DataFam,
I made a plan to project my portfolio where there would be end to end projects and I would use all the tools.

Tools Used: 
    1. Mysql Database,
    2. Bigquery, 
    3. Python( Numpy,Matplotlib),
    4. Data Modelling(Luicd Chart), 
    5. Looker Studio.

I made Chatgpt my stakeholder and gave him the dataset and said you think you are a stakeholder and you create a problem statement for me. And he made me a wonderful problem statement.

Problem Statment:"This will enable us to optimize our discount strategies, increase sales revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction."

Step:
1. Data Colletion From Kaggle.
2. Star schema data modeling done using luicd charts.
3. Then put the dataset in mysql database.
4. Then I connected with mysql database using jupyter notebook and cleaned and preprocessed the data for use.
5. Data Analysis and Cleaning using SQL.
6. Then I imported the clean dataset into Google bigquery as a CSV file.
7. Then I visualized the data by connecting google bigquery with looker studio.
